          <h2>Intro</h2>
          <p>The Bride of Christ Fellowship is a small town church that serves their community in a number of ways. Their primary concern is to provide support for families and people in need by hosting food drives, clothing drives, and giving away essential items. The church consists of less than 50 members, so new volunteers are always more than welcomed. They have helped out countless families and individuals in the community and plan to continue at a larger scale.</p>
          <h2>Collaborating with the church</h2>
          <p>We have collaborated with the Bride of Christ Fellowship and formed a non-profit in an effort to facilitate the work they do for their community. The church's dedication and the morals they stand for make it obvious why we wanted to work with them. Our goal is to help the church add some structure to their processes and give them solutions to any problems they may face. By working with the church, we have been able to provide them with risk analysis, a structured way of receiving and storing donations, quality control methods to make sure donations are safe, and an organization that the community can rely on.  </p>
          
          <h2>The Team</h2>
          <ul>
             <li>-Lucas Fletcher</li>
             <li>-Massinissa Oukali</li>
             <li>-Pemphyle Nzuzi</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Because of our collaboration, we are able to provide the church with tools that make the jobs they do that much easier. One of the church's main activites is donating supplies to the community; anything from food, water, toys, or any essential items. Providing them with a website allows them to keep track of the donations they are receiving and accept more people to volunteer.</p>
